// WHY THIS EXISTS (day 23, 2026-08-08). The laptop was lid-closed until 13:01 and the briefing landed
// at 13:08. That MEETS this project's stated success criterion — "ready when the user first sits
// down" (2026-07-16 wake-triggered-delivery design, which superseded forcing a wake after an
// overnight test proved a lid-closed battery laptop cannot be woken from userspace).
//
// With only ONE timestamp printed, that success was indistinguishable from a failure. It was misread
// as one by two readers in sequence: an EVAL row was filed as DELIVERY FAILED, retracted, and then
// the retraction's own framing had to be corrected. Two printed timestamps prevent all of it.
