// C1/B5 — the bounded, fail-open capability probe. We ask the configured CLI `--help` and inject only
// the flags it actually lists, because an UNKNOWN FLAG IS FATAL to most CLIs: guessing wrong doesn't
// degrade the briefing, it destroys it, every morning, silently.
//
// `--help` is not a complete oracle (~45 hidden flags on claude 2.1.220), but the error is
// ONE-DIRECTIONAL — listed ⟹ accepted — so a hidden flag is a false negative and the probe fails
// OPEN, to today's unhardened behaviour. That asymmetry is the whole reason this is safe.
//
// BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IS PROVEN HERE: "listed ⟹ accepted" is a property of the real `claude` binary and
// NOTHING in this file tests it. Every fake CLI below accepts whatever it is given, so the fixtures model
// the converse at best (see pickyClaude in harden.ladder.test.ts, which models listed-but-rejected — the
// honest and useful half, and the reason the B6 ladder exists). The premise was verified OUT of band, by
// a real-provider ship-smoke against claude 2.1.220: all four flags listed, all four accepted, and
// `--tools=` observed actually gating the built-in tools in 0-of-3 hardened runs. Treat it as a stated,
// separately-measured assumption — not something this suite establishes.
//
// Real subprocesses throughout (`sh`), matching the house style: the properties under test are about
// what a child process actually does to our pipes, which a spawn spy cannot model.
