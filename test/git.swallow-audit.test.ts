// C1/A1 — throwing IncompleteReadError is only half the fix. Every frame that catches must let it
// through, or the fix is a NO-OP for its two motivating protections. The SEVENTH review round caught
// this, after six rounds had all audited git.ts and stopped at its boundary. (Not "the final" review —
// several more followed, and the sibling header was corrected for the same reason.)
//
//  - git.ts `gitDirExists`'s swallow-to-false  → an incomplete read would read as "not a git repo"
//  - git.ts `resolveAuthor`'s two swallows-to-"" → would degrade to NO AUTHOR FILTER, crediting
//    coworkers' commits — the exact failure the error class exists to prevent
//
// Cited by SYMBOL, not by line: these sites moved at every commit on this branch, and a stale line
// number in a comment this codebase treats as documentation sends the next reader to unrelated code.
//
// Everything that is NOT an IncompleteReadError must keep being swallowed exactly as before: these
// catches exist because an unborn HEAD, a missing git config, or a detached HEAD are all normal.
