// test/extractor.incomplete-read.test.ts
//
// C1/A1 — the swallow audit must extend PAST git.ts. Throwing IncompleteReadError from runGit is a
// NO-OP for its two motivating protections unless extractor's phase-1 frames let it through:
//
//   resolveAuthor's own fallbacks (git.ts), which return `{}`
//     resolveAuthor only touches git when cfg.author is ABSENT — exactly the case those fallbacks
//     fire in. Degrading to {} means NO AUTHOR FILTER, so every commit in the repo matches and
//     coworkers' commits get credited to the user. Fixing only git.ts achieves nothing here.
//     (Phase 1 briefly carried its own `.catch(() => cfg.author ?? {})` guard for this; it was
//     removed as dead code once the outer catch was proven to be the actual protection.)
//
//   extractor.ts  catch → `if (await gitDirExists(repo)) return { days: [], ... }`
//     An IncompleteReadError from committerDaysWithCommits lands in the unborn-HEAD branch. The
//     repo IS a git repo (only the pipe was held), so gitDirExists says true and it returns ZERO
//     DAYS with no issue and no warning — a fabricated quiet day, which then stamps the day. The
//     spec calls this outcome worse than the hang it replaces.
//
// Six review rounds all audited git.ts and stopped at its boundary; the seventh caught this. Later
// rounds then closed the per-command holds (config / log / rev-list) that a blanket hold can't isolate.
