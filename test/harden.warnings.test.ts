// C1/B8 — dynamic warnings must reach the briefing. Two classes exist: STATIC ones (argv conflicts, the
// cwd-ladder rung) are known before the provider runs and already ride core's `warnings[]`. DYNAMIC
// ones — probe anomalies, and later the flag-rejection ladder's outcome — are only known DURING
// `generate()`, which happens after core has assembled its list. Without an explicit merge they are
// simply lost, and a "hardening disabled, then failed anyway" morning is logged as a bare ProviderError
// with no hint of why.
//
// WHY NOT JUST PUSH ONTO THE SHARED ARRAY: `generator.ts` passes `warnings: meta.warnings` BY REFERENCE,
// so `struct.warnings` initially aliases core's array — but it then REASSIGNS `struct.warnings = [...]`
// when a cited SHA fails verification, detaching the alias. That reassignment is conditional, so
// aliasing survives on some mornings and not others: a late push would land in the briefing or vanish
// depending on whether a SHA happened to fail that day. Non-deterministic, so the merge must be explicit.
