// test/promote-resume.test.ts — S1 "resume-promotion" (EVAL day 43).
//
// MEASURED DEFECT, two consecutive mornings: a RESUME bullet ended with an explicit next action
// ("Resume: audit day-42 briefing next", "…resume by committing them or confirming they're meant to
// stay local") and that action never appeared under "Suggested next". Day-43 judge: "any Resume:
// action must become suggestion #1 or the block is redundant."
//
// ⚠ THE SECOND EXEMPLAR IS NO LONGER PROMOTABLE, and that is deliberate (EVAL day 51). "committing
// THEM" is anaphoric — the files are named only before the marker — so the day-51 rule declines it.
// It remains the correct illustration of the day-43 DEFECT (an action that never reached the block);
// it is no longer an example of what this module now emits. The day-51 fire showed why: promoted
// alone, such a clause points at nothing. See test/day51-anaphoric-promotions.test.ts.
//
// Pinned at THREE levels, because an extracted function's own tests let its call site regress
// invisibly (the precedent is the account-failover review, cited in generator.suggestion-filter):
//   1. the pure function        — promoteResumeActions
//   2. the pipeline seam        — generateBriefing (where clusterRecap is applied), including the
//                                 guards-then-promote-then-guards ORDER, both directions
//   3. the two downstream consumers — render's provenance label, postcheck's channel skip
//
// ⚠ THE BOUNDARY CASES BELOW ARE MUTATION KILLS, not decoration. A first round of tests passed
// against COVERED_CONTAINMENT 0.5→0.99, MIN_ACTION_CHARS 10→6, and slice-to-sentence→slice-to-end:
// every constant was unpinned. Each `boundary:` test exists to fail on one specific mutant, and the
// containment numbers are MEASURED against src/postcheck's own contentTokens/containment, not
// estimated (an earlier fixture "obviously" covering scored 3 shared tokens and would have been
// silently un-covered by the two-gate rule).
