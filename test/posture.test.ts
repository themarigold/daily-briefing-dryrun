// C2 — the release gate must be able to state the security posture it measured.
//
// After C1, the provider can silently end up with MORE authority than the default: a capability probe
// anomaly, a `--help` that hides `--tools` (claude 2.1.220 hides ~45 flags), a user's own conflicting
// argv, `provider.harden: false`, or the B6 ladder latching hardening off mid-run. Every one of those
// raises a `runtimeWarnings` entry — and `scripts/eval.ts` and `scripts/audit.ts` currently drop all of
// them on the floor.
//
// The point is NOT that a partially-unhardened run produces different briefing text; on synthetic gold
// cases it very likely produces identical text. The point is provenance: **a gate that cannot state the
// posture it measured is not a gate.** An `EVAL.md` row recorded under unknown hardening cannot be
// compared against a later one.
//
// The judge providers are the sharper half: `eval.ts` and `audit.ts` each build a SECOND
// `hardenedProvider` that never passes through `runCore`, so unlike the main path — where `core.ts`
// folds warnings into `struct.warnings` — their warnings are genuinely lost rather than merely unprinted.
