// alone is a security REGRESSION. Today the provider inherits whatever cwd the launchd job had (`/`,
// where nothing is discovered). B1 moves it to a directory under `$HOME`, which makes `~/CLAUDE.md` an
// ANCESTOR of the provider's cwd and therefore steering input the model reads. Only B4's
// `--setting-sources user` + `--strict-mcp-config` make the narrower cwd a net win. Split them and the
// intermediate commit is worse than doing nothing.
