//
// F2 — `run()` (the audit script's spawn helper) must not hang on a held pipe, and must not report
// a partial read as success.
//
// The bug it fixes: scripts/audit.ts awaited `Promise.all([stdout.text(), stderr.text()])` BEFORE
// `p.exited`, with NO flush race at all — strictly worse than the `runGit` bug fixed in #116, which
// at least awaited `exited` first. A child that exits while a backgrounded grandchild holds the
// inherited pipe never EOFs, so `.text()` never resolves and the audit hangs forever. It runs against
// the REAL repos, which is the population where that pathology actually occurs.
//
// The policy, and why it differs per caller (see src/proc.ts's header): `run()` decides NOTHING about
// what a partial read means. It reports `complete`, and additionally forces `code = -1` when stdout
// did not reach EOF — because `code` already means "did this invocation produce trustworthy output"
// (a spawn throw has always mapped to -1), and both existing call sites already gate on it. That
// makes the safe behaviour the one you get without an edit: a caller that never reads `complete`
// still cannot mistake a partial read for success.
//
// The fixture import is for isolation.meta.test.ts's scanner 6. The SIGNAL-killed test below runs
// `run(["bun", "run", "src/main.ts"])` against a mocked Bun.spawn. The scanner cannot see the mock, and
// the import is what it asks of every file that hands `run()` an entry.
