//
// C1/A2 + C1/A3 — two live bugs in how a failing provider is classified and reported.
//
// A2 (provider.ts): `if (/not found|ENOENT/i.test(err)) throw missing-binary`. `withRetry` treats
//     missing-binary as PERMANENT — no retry, ever. So any wrapper CLI whose usage text happens to
//     contain "not found" gets zero retries and a misleading "CLI not found" on a binary that
//     exists. Gate it on exit 127 (the shell's real command-not-found code); a genuine missing
//     binary already throws ENOENT at spawn time, before this line is reachable.
//
// A3 (provider.ts): the diag prefers stderr and only falls back to stdout when stderr is EMPTY.
//     `claude` prints a benign advisory to stderr on otherwise-successful runs when an auth env
//     var is set, which makes `err.trim()` truthy — so the stdout fallback added to diagnose the
//     2026-07-11 launchd failure never fires, and the real message is thrown away again.
