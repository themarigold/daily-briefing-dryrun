// ⚠ A FAIL-OPEN POSTCHECK TEST USED TO SIT HERE and was DELETED on 2026-08-11, when the postcheck
// block moved out of `generateBriefing` into `runCore` (core.ts). Recorded rather than dropped
// silently, because deleting a safety test looks like weakening one and this is the opposite.
//
// It proved the try/catch by reaching the catch: it passed `meta.todaySuppress` a label of `123`
// cast through `unknown`, so `norm()` called `.toLowerCase()` on a number and threw. That worked
// only because `todaySuppress` crossed a PARAMETER boundary a test could poison. At the new call
// site there is no such boundary — `todaySuppress` is built inside `runCore` from real commits, and
// every other input (`struct.resume`, `struct.suggestions`, `struct.branchState`) is constructed in
// that same function from parsed model text and git output.
//
// So the catch is now UNREACHABLE UNDER THE TYPE CONTRACT, and the honest options were to mock the
// module or to say so. Mocking would have introduced `mock.module` — a pattern this suite uses
// nowhere else — for a single test. The wrapper STAYS (a diagnostic must never cost the morning;
// see core.ts), and it is now defence against future callers rather than an exercised path. If a
// later change gives postcheck an input from outside `runCore`, restore a test with it.
//
// Left behind here: `SAMPLE` and the `Provider` import are still used by the tests below.
