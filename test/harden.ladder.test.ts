// C1/B6 — the flag-rejection ladder. The probe proves a flag's NAME exists in `--help`; it cannot prove
// the VALUE FORM is accepted, and it false-positives on help text that mentions a flag in deprecation
// prose. So injection can still be rejected, and an unknown/invalid flag is FATAL: the CLI exits nonzero
// on its own usage error, which is indistinguishable from a wake-before-wifi failure. Without a rung
// that says "the last failure had our flags in it — try again without them", withRetry burns all three
// attempts and the user gets NO BRIEFING, every morning, until somebody reads the log.
//
// Two rungs, because the evidence differs:
//   FAST PATH — stderr matches a known rejection phrase. Rejection is PROVEN, so act immediately:
//   disable, warn, retry bare. Measured recovery 3.09s / 2 calls versus 138.4s / 5 without it.
//   AMBIGUOUS — nonzero exit with nothing conclusive on stderr. Cannot distinguish "rejected our flag"
//   from "network hiccup", so only probe it on the LAST withRetry attempt, and only if the attempt
//   failed FAST (a usage error returns in ~90ms; a real provider call does not).
