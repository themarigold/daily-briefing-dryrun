// test/provider.credential.test.ts — which credential the spawned CLI is allowed to use.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The app spawns the user's `claude` CLI, which bills either its logged-in
// SUBSCRIPTION or API CREDITS depending on whether `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is in its environment — the
// key wins when present. The app used to hand its whole environment to the child (`provider.ts`'s
// spawn merges `...process.env`, and where no env option is passed at all `Bun.spawn` inherits
// everything), so a machine-wide key silently re-billed a subscription to API credits FOR WEEKS.
// Nothing in any output stated which credential a run used, so a wrong belief had nothing to
// collide with.
//
// REAL SUBPROCESSES, not a spawn spy — the same house-style argument test/provider.opts.test.ts:10-13
// makes for the env merge: "a spy would assert what we passed, not what the child actually received,
// and it is the child's view that matters." That is doubly true here, where the mechanism is a
// delete-after-merge on a copied object and the only proof is what the child can read.
//
// ⚠ THE SENTINEL IS INJECTED, NEVER AMBIENT. A developer machine may well have a real
// `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exported (this one does); CI will not. A test written against ambient state
// would pass here and go vacuous — or invert — on CI. Every case below plants its own value through
// `opts.env` so the assertions mean the same thing everywhere. And no fixture ever ECHOES the key —
// they classify it (MATCH/EMPTY/OTHER, see `classify` below), so a REGRESSION cannot print a real
// credential into a failure message. Both halves are needed: planting keeps the green path honest,
// classifying keeps the red path safe.

 *  with a real key exported the fixture writes the REAL key and the failing `toContain` prints it.

 *  on the success path, and this session already leaked this machine's key once through output shaped
 *  exactly like that.
 *
