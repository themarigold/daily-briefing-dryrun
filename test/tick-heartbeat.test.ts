  // `nowIso.slice(0, 10)` — the UTC date. West of Greenwich those two disagree for the last N hours of
  // every local day, so from 17:00 local this UTC-7 machine rewrote `today=1` on every tick: the exact
  // value STATE.md watch 1 reads as "launchd never fired", displayed at the hour a "why was there no
  // briefing today?" investigation actually runs. Local midnight then brought no reset at all.
  //
  // EVERY case above pairs a `2026-08-20T…Z` stamp with `today="2026-08-20"` — arg 1's UTC date always
  // already equals arg 2, the one condition under which the broken comparison was sound — so none of
  // them can fail on this defect. These pair a NEXT-DAY UTC stamp with a SAME-DAY local date.
  // Rows are (local wall clock → the UTC instant it maps to at UTC-7), from the reproduction in EVAL.md.
