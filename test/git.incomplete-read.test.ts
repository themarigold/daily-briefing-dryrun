// C1/A1 — `runGit` must distinguish "empty because the tree is clean" (success) from "empty
// because a grandchild is holding the pipe and it never EOF'd" (FAIL CLOSED).
//
// The bug: git.ts awaited `Promise.all([stdout.text(), stderr.text()])` BEFORE `p.exited`, with no
// race. A git that exits 0 while a backgrounded grandchild holds the inherited pipe never EOFs, and
// `timeout` cannot fire because the child already exited cleanly — so runGit hung forever.
//
// The trap in the obvious fix: `.text()` is all-or-nothing (it resolves only at EOF), so racing it
// against a flush window yields "" rather than a partial. Since "" is a LEGITIMATE success for
// runGit (`git log` with no in-window commits; `git status --porcelain` on a clean tree), the naive
// port silently returns "" as success — a fabricated quiet day that stamps the day. That is worse
// than the hang, which at least fails visibly.

// proves `raceFlush` releases what it is given; these prove `runGit` gives it both handles.
