// turn that PASSED the ingest scan cannot match output-side, which means redaction can never fire
// inside a why — it fires only on git-derived or diagnostic text. Split the patterns and invariant 5
// ("byte-equal on every path and sink") and the redact-in-place rule are in direct conflict with no

// ⚠ HONEST SCOPE. The claim is NOT "credentials get detection". It is: KNOWN-SHAPED credentials get
// detection; unknown-shaped ones fall back to the PII posture (opt-in + minimisation + own-account +
// never-persist-raw). These patterns close literal STRINGS, not classes — `mysql -p S3cretPW`
// (spaced), `cookie:session=…` (lowercase), `Set-Cookie:`, `TOKEN: 'sk-…'`, a newline between `=`
// and the value, and `{"apiKey":"sk-…"}` all still pass. Say "these literals are caught", never
// "the class is closed".
//
// Entropy scoring was DELETED, not deferred: zero measured true positives and two HIGH findings.
