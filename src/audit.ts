// app renders each one as `🔀 Merged #N (branch) (sha)`. Absence from the evidence then read as
// invention, and the judge returned a Ground FAIL on a REAL, verified merge on days 27, 28 AND 29
// (`071461a`, `2eb9310`, `07dc91f`+`be2d501` — each confirmed with `git cat-file` / `gh pr view`).
// They are returned separately rather than folded into `lines`/`shas`, because the blindness count
// must keep excluding them exactly as before: this is a COVERAGE fix, not a counting change.
// Post-generation merges go to `postGeneration` tagged `(merge)`, so nothing is silently dropped.
//
// ⚠ `prMerges` vs `otherMerges` — added after review, and the split is the whole point. The app's
// `listPrMerges` (git.ts) renders ONLY subjects matching PR_MERGE_SUBJECT; a `Merge branch 'x'` or a
// `git pull` merge is surfaced by NEITHER channel. A first draft returned every 2+-parent commit
// under a heading claiming the app surfaces them, which would have invited the mirror-image false

//   • `git fetch` moves `@{u}` — which `isBranchNotable` reads via ahead/behind (git.ts) — and writes
//     NO HEAD reflog entry. So "HEAD did not move" was emitted as "the branch state IS comparable"
//     while ahead/behind had silently changed underneath it. A confident, wrong endorsement.
//   • HEAD's reflog records ordinary `commit:` entries, so on any day the author commits after the
//     briefing runs, the guard fired "moved" and told the judge to drop EVERY branch finding.
//     Blanket suppression would have been the normal case, not the edge case.

 * reclassify all 35 as missing, i.e. FABRICATED — a false-fabrication verdict on real commits, the
 * exact error class PR #140 was opened to remove, firing on 14 in-window commits immediately. The
 * audit already draws this distinction elsewhere (ambiguous ≠ fabricated, the 4-char floor); this
 * keeps it. Orphaned is a WARNING about durability; fabricated is an accusation of hallucination.
 *
 * `reachablePerRepo` holds each readable repo's full `rev-list --all` output. A cited SHA may be

THE APP BRIEFING UNDER REVIEW:
${parts.briefing}

GIT GROUND TRUTH — the author-filtered in-window activity the briefing was built from (independently
recomputed; the recap must be consistent with this and must not claim anything absent from it).
Per-commit file lists come from \`git log --numstat\`; MERGE commits list no files, so an absent file
list does NOT prove a commit changed nothing. Working-tree facts here reflect NOW, and repos change
between the briefing's generation and this audit (the vault auto-commits every ~10 min) — prefer the
briefing's own "state as of HH:MM" stamp and drift warnings over calling a mismatch fabrication.
REF REACHABILITY likewise reflects NOW: branches move, and this repo lands PRs by SQUASH-merge then
deletes the branch, which legitimately orphans that branch's working commits AFTER the briefing
correctly described them. A commit reachable from no ref may therefore be ordinary post-merge
cleanup, not loss. Decide from the "squash-landed PR-shaped commit(s)" list below — the evidence in
THIS prompt: if a squash-landed commit's subject plausibly covers the same lane of work, report
post-merge cleanup; report LOSS only when NO squash-landed commit could carry it, and when unsure
say so rather than choosing. (You see squash SUBJECTS only, not bodies — do not claim to have
checked a commit's body.) And never infer a PR's nonexistence from the "PR merge(s)" heading alone —
that heading counts only TRUE merge commits. Squash landings are single-parent commits: the
PRE-generation ones appear in the COMMIT lists, while POST-generation ones appear ONLY in the
squash-landed list (tagged "landed AFTER generation") and the post-generation note:

 *   - `!complete` — a pipe existed and never reached EOF. The generation may well have SUCCEEDED and
 *     we simply could not read all of it, so re-running IS the right move. `run()` forces `code` to -1
 *     here, so without this clause the operator stares at an exit code no process returned.
 *   - `signal` — the child was killed. It EOFs its pipes on death, so `complete` is true and the
 *     truncation clause is correctly suppressed, leaving a bare `exit=1` that looks like an ordinary
 *     failure. An OOM-killed generator is a different problem from one that ran and failed.
 *
 * `detail` is expected to arrive already sanitized: it carries the generator's stderr, which embeds
 * model output and therefore commit-subject-influenceable text, and this string rides a thrown Error
 * to `main().catch` — which console.errors it WITHOUT the report-side sanitization.
