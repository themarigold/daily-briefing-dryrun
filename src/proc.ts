// src/proc.ts — spawn a child, collect both pipes without hanging, and report FACTS about the read.
//
// F2. Extracted from `scripts/audit.ts` (2026-07-26) — where it was unreachable by tests, since that
// file ends in a bare `main().catch(...)` and importing it would run the whole audit. It lives in
// `src/` because every test in this suite imports from `src/`; nothing else imports it, and it makes
// no claim to be a general-purpose spawn abstraction.
//
// The bug: the original awaited `Promise.all([stdout.text(), stderr.text()])` BEFORE `p.exited`, with
// no flush race at all — strictly worse than the `runGit` bug #116 fixed, which at least awaited
// `exited` first. `.text()` resolves only at EOF, so a backgrounded grandchild holding the inherited
// pipe hangs the audit forever. Unlike the gold-case fixtures, the audit runs against the REAL repos.
//
// POLICY LIVES WITH THE CALLER — still true after F1, though stream.ts's wording changed: the flush
// RACE moved into stream.ts (it was four textually identical blocks), while every conclusion drawn
// from a partial read stayed with its caller. This function concludes nothing about what
// a partial read MEANS; it reports the facts and lets each call site decide. The two current callers
// reach the same verdict for different reasons, and both are fail-closed:
//   - the `git` wrapper: "" is a LEGITIMATE git result (clean tree, no in-window commits), so treating
//     a partial read as success fabricates a quiet day — the hazard #116 exists to prevent.
//   - the regeneration call: its output is graded, not read by a human. `provider.ts` deliberately
//     RETURNS a partial briefing because a person gets something rather than nothing; that asymmetry
//     does not transfer to a measuring instrument, where a truncated briefing scored as whole yields a
//     confidently wrong EVAL.md row.
//
// `code` is ALSO forced to -1 on an incomplete stdout. That is fact-reporting rather than policy:
// `code` already means "did this invocation produce trustworthy output" — a spawn throw has always
// mapped to -1 — and it makes the safe behaviour the default. Both existing call sites already gate
// on `code`, so the fix routes into their failure branch with no edit, and a future call site that
// never reads `complete` still cannot mistake a partial read for success. (What each call site then
// REPORTS is a separate question, and getting it wrong is how a fail-closed read still produced a
// confidently wrong audit — see scripts/audit.ts's degraded-read handling.)
//
// `complete` means STDOUT REACHED EOF. It does NOT mean "the payload is whole": a child killed by a
// signal closes its fds, so a truncated payload can arrive with `complete: true`. `code` is the only
// guard in that case, which is what makes the `?? 1` below load-bearing rather than incidental.
