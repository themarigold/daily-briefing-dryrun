// Ref selection for every "what commits exist" query — shared with the audit tool so its ground
// truth can't drift from the app's view.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS AN ALLOWLIST, and it was an `--all`-minus-exclusions list until 2026-08-11. The three
// exclusions were right about WHAT to drop and wrong about HOW, because `--all` means every ref
// under `refs/`, and third-party tools write there. MEASURED on this repo: Cline (an editor
// extension) parks checkpoints under `refs/cline/checkpoints/<session>/<n>`, and they are
// STASH-SHAPED — `git for-each-ref --contains 1623e2cb` resolves to exactly that ref, and the pair
// it adds beyond any branch is `On <branch>: cline checkpoint session=…` plus
// `index on <branch>: 8cefd594 …`. So `--exclude=refs/stash` was defeated by a stash living
// somewhere other than `refs/stash`, and the day-26 briefing shipped that index commit as a
// "Today so far" item BESIDE the real commit it wraps.
//
// ⚠ AND THE SECOND SYMPTOM WAS THE SAME CAUSE, not an independent bug. A stash index commit whose
// tree matches its parent has an EMPTY diffstat, so `unitForCommit`'s majority-root vote has no
// files to count and falls back to the repo label: the wrapper rendered as `[personal_code]` while
// the real commit rendered `[accountant_ai]`. One line, two labels, one underlying fix. Filtering
// by SUBJECT (`^(index|WIP) on `) would have hidden both symptoms and left the actual hole open —
// the next tool to write a differently-shaped ref walks straight back in.
//
// What the allowlist keeps, and why each is needed rather than merely harmless:
//  - --branches: the user's work. This is the whole point.
//  - --tags: a commit reachable only from a tag (released, branch since deleted) is still work.
//  - --ignore-missing HEAD: a DETACHED HEAD has no branch, and `--all` DID include HEAD (git's
//    docs: "all the refs in refs/, along with HEAD"), so plain `--branches --tags` would silently
//    lose the current checkout's history — the one thing a resumption briefing must never miss.
//    MEASURED: on a detached HEAD, `--branches --tags` reports only the branch commit while
//    `--branches --tags --ignore-missing HEAD` reports both.
//    ⚠ `--ignore-missing` IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DEFENSIVE DRESSING. On an UNBORN HEAD (`git init`,
//    no commit yet) bare `HEAD` is an unknown revision: git exits 128 with
//    `fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD'`, where the old `--all` form exited 0 with empty output.
//    That is the brand-new-repo-with-staged-work case `extractor.ts` exists to reach, and although
//    its defensive branch would catch the throw, converting a clean path into an error path on the
//    FIRST run in a new repo is not a trade worth making. With the flag: exit 0, empty. Measured
//    2026-08-11 on the git in this environment; the `extractor.ts` note about older gits stands.
// What it now drops BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by enumeration — the three former exclusions, plus
// every future namespace nobody has thought of:
//  - refs/remotes/*: work you did on ANOTHER machine, or a GitHub squash-merge preserving you as
//    author — the briefing claims "LOCAL GIT ACTIVITY on THIS machine only", and these also shift
//    the shared window.
//  - refs/notes/*: metadata, not work commits.
//  - refs/stash: "WIP on …"/"index on …" would surface as phantom commits and skew the
//    last-working-day window. A stash is resumption state and has its OWN signal — `git stash list`
//    in `resumptionSignals` below — which is why dropping it here loses nothing.

/** `git patch-id --stable` for a BATCH of SHAs — the content fingerprint git itself uses for cherry
 *  detection: two commits with equal stable patch-ids carry the identical change (rebase copies
 *  match even when hunk offsets shifted). Defect E (EVAL day 33): a rebase-merge plus a stale local
 *  branch put the SAME five changes into "Today so far" twice under different SHAs.
 *
 *  TWO SPAWNS PER CALL, not two per SHA (IN-1 round 1): one
 *  `git log --no-walk=unsorted --stdin -p` feeding one `git patch-id --stable`, which prints
 *  `<patch-id> <commit-sha>` per patch — so the SHA association comes back for free and no second
 *  pass is needed to recover it. Measured on the IN-1 fixtures: 433 commits in one group
 *  10,784ms → 82ms (the round-0 per-SHA form vs the SHIPPED spool form below; the round-1 pipe that
 *  measured 75ms here is gone), patch-id map identical per SHA to the per-SHA form.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE TWO SPAWNS ARE NOT PIPED TO EACH OTHER — the patch stream is SPOOLED THROUGH A PRIVATE
 *  TEMP FILE, and that is a memory correctness fix, not a style choice (IN-1 round 2). Round 1 wrote
 *  `stdin: log.stdout` and this docstring claimed it was "an OS-level pipe … memory stays flat in the
 *  batch size". BOTH HALVES WERE FALSE, measured: `stdin: <subprocess>.stdout` is NOT an fd handoff
 *  in Bun — the parent READS the producer's pipe and writes it to the consumer, and it does NOT
 *  propagate backpressure, so whenever the consumer drains slower than the producer emits (which is
 *  exactly `git patch-id --stable` against `git log -p`) the unread difference accumulates in the
 *  PARENT's address space, unbounded. Measured with no git involved at all (a 4 MB-then-stall
 *  consumer): parent peak RSS 154 MB at a 50 MB stream and 400 MB at 150 MB, against a flat 32 MB
 *  for the same producer/consumer joined by a real shell pipe. On this function's own fixture
 *  (60 commits, 86.2 MB of patch text; peak RSS via `/usr/bin/time -l`, median of 3) the shipped
 *  round-1 form peaked at **57.3 / 161.4 / 271.7 MB at 5.7 / 43.1 / 86.2 MB of patch stream** —
 *  ~2.7 MB of RSS per MB of stream; the round-0 per-SHA form it replaced peaked at 72 MB. So
 *  batching had INVERTED the property this comment asserted: round 0 peaked at O(largest patch),
 *  round 1 at O(whole collision group), with no cap on group size.
 *
 *  Spooling to a file restores it FOR REAL: the kernel owns every byte, this process reads only
 *  patch-id's own output (~50 bytes per commit). Same fixture, same method, peak RSS
 *  **40.7 / 40.9 / 41.0 MB** at those same three stream sizes — flat across a 15x stream increase
 *  (+0.3 MB), against a 37.7 MB floor for a bun process that does no patch-id work at all. The
 *  trade is wall-clock on the pathological row only: 272ms → 521ms at 86 MB, because the two stages
 *  serialise and the bytes round-trip through the filesystem; on the real cost table below the
 *  streams are kilobytes and the spool costs a file create + unlink. Pinned by
 *  `test/day33-batch.test.ts` ("patchIds does not pipe the patch stream through this process").
 *  Costs transient DISK equal to the stream instead of RAM, which is the trade we want for a
 *  background 7:20 run. Rejected alternatives, both measured: one `sh -c 'git log … | git patch-id'`
 *  is genuinely flat (36 MB) but this repo targets Windows (`provider.ts`, `harden.ts`'s win32
 *  branch) and its CI runs the suite on ubuntu, where `/bin/sh` is dash and `set -o pipefail` — the
 *  only way a shell reports a FAILING git-log through a pipeline — does not exist; chunking the SHA
 *  list only plateaus (88 MB at chunk 4, 246 MB at chunk 64) because the allocator does not return
 *  the high-water mark between chunks. A serialised spool also cannot deadlock by construction:
 *  there is no pipe between the two processes to fill.
 *
 *  BEST-EFFORT by design: any failure (git missing patch-id, timeout, nonzero exit, an unknown SHA,
 *  or a merge commit — `log -p` emits no patch for one) simply omits those SHAs from the map, and
 *  the caller keeps every copy — fail open, never fail the briefing. Batching widens ONE failure's
 *  blast radius from a single SHA to the group; that is the SAFE direction, because the caller drops
 *  nothing it could not fingerprint. Bounded: callers pre-filter to commits whose SUBJECT collides
 *  within their repo — since IN-1 for the WINDOW list as well as the same-day one, so the number of
 *  CALLS grew while the per-call cost became O(1) spawns in N. Uses Bun.spawn directly rather than
 *  runGit, which is single-command by contract; both spawns carry runGit's GIT_TIMEOUT_MS + SIGKILL,
 *  so a wedged git cannot hold the briefing open.
 *
 *  TWO MEASURED RESIDUALS of the spool, neither a defect, both recorded so the next reader does not
 *  have to re-derive them. (1) The cleanup is an in-process `finally`, so killing the PARENT mid-spool
 *  leaks the directory — reproduced under SIGKILL and under SIGTERM, which is what launchd sends
 *  (SIGINT leaves nothing; Bun unwinds). The orphaned `git log` child even keeps writing after the
 *  parent dies, so the residue is the group's FULL stream, not a partial one. It is nonetheless
 *  negligible HERE: a real day-34-shaped group (10 commits, 5 patch-identical pairs) spools 481
 *  BYTES, and macOS reaps `/var/folders/…` via `com.apple.bsd.dirhelper` daily at 03:35 with
 *  CLEAN_FILES_OLDER_THAN_DAYS=3; CI is an ephemeral ubuntu runner whose /tmp dies with the job. A
 *  year of daily runs, assuming a kill landed in the millisecond-wide window EVERY day, is under
 *  ~1.5 KB. No startup sweep is therefore warranted. (2) UNVERIFIED (no Linux host): where TMPDIR is
 *  a tmpfs — Ubuntu 24.04+ and several distros default /tmp that way — the bytes go back into RAM as
 *  page cache rather than onto disk. That relocates the cost rather than removing it, and because
 *  page cache is not process RSS, the test pin above would still PASS while the memory is still
 *  consumed. Not a concern for the stated production target (macOS, disk-backed APFS TMPDIR). */
