// src/net.ts — provider-agnostic connectivity probe. A raw TCP connect is enough to prove the network
// is up (no TLS, so no cert/SNI issues for IP-literal hosts); the actual provider is what proves the
// provider is up. Bun.connect has NO connect-timeout, so each connect is RACED against a timer; the
// timer resolves the race to false — a socket that DOES connect is `.end()`'d in `open()`, and a
// still-pending (blackholed) connect is simply abandoned (harmless — the process exits per tick).

// (wrong shape, out-of-range port, forgot the array brackets) must not crash the network gate or
// silently settle it into permanent non-delivery — fall back to the defaults and surface a warning
// instead, so the run still completes and the misconfiguration is visible in the briefing.
// `fallback` (A3/T9, ADDITIVE with a default that preserves today's behaviour EXACTLY): what to probe
// when the config says nothing. The caller derives it — for an API provider, the endpoint the run will
// actually talk to, or `[]` for a local model — because this module stays provider-agnostic per the
// header above. An EXPLICIT config value always wins, `[]` included; `raw === undefined` on the first
// line is the only place the fallback is consulted, and that is pinned by a test.
/** Name the fallback ACTUALLY IN EFFECT, not "defaults". Since A3/T9 the caller can supply an
 *  endpoint-derived list — and for a loopback api endpoint that list is `[]`, which DISABLES the gate.
