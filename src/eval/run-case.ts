/** F3 — the fourth and last hand-rolled child-process read in the codebase, converged onto `run()`.
 *
 *  The last one on any path C1 bounds — `config.ts`'s `resolveCliPath` keeps the same shape and is
 *  deliberately unconverged (its own comment cites C1 rev 3.4), so "the last in the codebase" would
 *  be wrong. It had the same shape the other three had: `await new Response(p.stdout).text()` BEFORE
 *  `p.exited`, with no flush race. `.text()` resolves only at EOF, so a grandchild holding the
 *  inherited pipe hangs it forever. Unreachable in practice on the tiny synthetic fixture repos this
 *  harness builds — except under a global `core.fsmonitor` — which is why it was filed as hygiene
 *  rather than a bug. `run()` bounds it with DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS (30s) and DEFAULT_FLUSH_MS (500ms).
 *
 *  ⚠ THE `code` GATE IS LOAD-BEARING, not defensive. Before, `.text()` awaited EOF, so this could
 *  HANG but never truncate. `run()` races a flush window, so a partial read is now possible — and a
 *  short `rev-list --all` would silently shrink `gitShaSet`, making correctly-cited SHAs look
 *  FABRICATED and producing a false `fail` row. `proc.ts` forces `code = -1` on an incomplete stdout,
 *  so gating on `code !== 0` converts that into a throw. Hang becomes throw; truncation is
 *  unreachable. Never relax this gate to `!r.complete` or to a stderr check.
 *
 *  ⚠ `code === -1` is NOT iff-incomplete: `proc.ts`'s outer catch returns it for a spawn failure too
 *  (measured: `run(["definitely-not-a-real-binary-xyz"])` -> `{code:-1, spawned:false}`). Hence the
 *  `spawned` arm first — reporting a missing `git` as "incomplete read" is exactly the conflation
 *  `git.ts` and `proc.ts` are documented to prevent.
 *
 *  Exported for tests only — see test/eval/run-case.gitlines.test.ts. Its in-module callers are the
 *  two below; nothing outside this module should use it. */

/** Classify a failed `RunResult` into one operator-facing cause. Extracted from `gitLines` so each
 *  arm — and their ORDER — can be pinned directly: driving them through a spawn fake is impossible,
 *  because `gitLines` hardcodes `run()`'s defaults and a fake cannot reach Bun's `timeout`. Three
 *  arms shipped unpinned before this extraction (checkpoint review measured deleting the `timedOut`
 *  arm, swapping it with the `-1` arm, and deleting the `signal` arm as all leaving the suite green).
 *
 *  ⚠ THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, and my first explanation of why was FALSE — corrected here because
 *  it argued against its own conclusion. It claimed a timeout always returns `code: 1, complete:
 *  true` and never `-1`; if that were so, the `timedOut` and `-1` arms would be mutually exclusive
 *  and their order would not matter at all. Measured, BOTH shapes occur:
 *      run(["sh","-c","echo x; exec sleep 5"], {timeoutMs:200}) -> {code:1,  complete:true,  timedOut:true}
 *      run(["sh","-c","echo x; sleep 5"],      {timeoutMs:200}) -> {code:-1, complete:false, timedOut:true}
 *  The second is a FORKED child holding the pipe past our kill — i.e. the wedged-git-hook case this
 *  whole convergence is about. So `timedOut` must precede the `-1` arm, or the 30s ceiling gets
 *  misreported as an incomplete read and the operator is told to re-run a job that will be killed
 *  again at the same limit (`proc.ts` keeps `timedOut` for exactly this).
 *
 *  Exported for tests only. */
