// src/eval/posture.ts — C2: let the release gate state the security posture it measured.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. After C1 the provider can end up with more authority than the default without anyone
// noticing: a capability-probe anomaly, a `--help` that hides `--tools` (claude 2.1.220 hides ~45 flags,
// so this is a stable per-version state, not a race), a user's own conflicting argv, `provider.harden:
// false`, or the B6 ladder latching hardening off mid-run. Each raises a `runtimeWarnings` entry, and the
// eval and audit reports were dropping all of them.
//
// The claim this supports is deliberately narrow. A partially-unhardened run probably produces IDENTICAL
// briefing text on synthetic gold cases, so this is not about contaminated numbers. It is about
// provenance: an `EVAL.md` row recorded under unknown hardening cannot honestly be compared with a later
// one. A gate that cannot state the posture it measured is not a gate.

/** Substrings marking a warning as speaking to hardening posture.
 *
 *  MY FIRST VERSION OF THIS LIST WAS WRONG, and the way it was wrong is the reason it now looks like
 *  this. It matched 7 of the 14 warnings the provider stack actually emits. Six of the seven misses were in the
 *  dangerous direction — a run whose working directory was never narrowed reported `posture: full`. (The
 *  seventh, the argv-widening warning, says "hardening still applies" in its own text, so it misdescribed
 *  the provider's AUTHORITY rather than its hardening — worth stating precisely rather than rounding up.) The comment
 *  defending it argued that a machine-readable channel would be "two things to keep in sync"; an ad-hoc
 *  substring list in a *different file* is precisely that, and it had already drifted before shipping.
 *
 *  Two changes rather than just adding the missing entries: the vocabulary is now grouped by the FAMILY
 *  of warning it covers, so a gap is visible by reading; and `test/posture.test.ts` parses `harden.ts`'s
 *  SOURCE — of both `harden.ts` and `provider.ts`, and including the `warning:` returns that reach a
 *  push site only through a variable — and fails if any goes unmatched. That mechanical guard is the actual fix — the
 *  list will drift again otherwise, because nothing about adding a warning prompts you to come here. */
