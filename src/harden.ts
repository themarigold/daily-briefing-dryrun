// src/harden.ts — C1/B1–B4, B9, B10: the hardening seam and what it injects.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE MODULE: imports `types`, `provider`, `probe`, `config`, `marker` only. It must never import
// `core`, which constructs the provider — that would close a cycle. Its own file makes the constraint
// mechanical rather than remembered.
//
// WHY ONE COMMIT FOR B1+B2+B3+B4: B1 alone is a security REGRESSION. Today the provider inherits the
// launchd job's cwd (`/`, where nothing is discovered). B1 moves it under `$HOME`, putting `$HOME` into
// the provider's ANCESTOR chain. Only B4's `--setting-sources user` — which drops project/local
// settings and therefore project HOOKS, the highest-severity injection-to-execution path — plus
// `--strict-mcp-config` make the narrower cwd a net win. The cwd move is therefore GATED on that flag
// actually being injected, not merely on the directory being creatable.
//
// CORRECTION (measured against claude 2.1.220's own --help): `--setting-sources` takes "a
// comma-separated list of setting sources to load (user, project, local)" — settings ONLY. It does NOT
// disable `CLAUDE.md` auto-discovery; that is `--safe-mode`/`--bare`. So `~/CLAUDE.md` is NOT
// neutralised here, and an earlier version of this comment claiming it was is simply wrong. The
// residual is bounded — a user-owned file an attacker cannot write without already having code
// execution — but a false justification in a security comment propagates, so it is corrected rather
// than repeated. `--safe-mode` is deliberately NOT adopted: it also disables the user-scoped
// settings/skills/plugins that this feature's invariant explicitly preserves. Note it would NOT be
// costing us user MCP servers on top of that — `--strict-mcp-config` is scope-BLIND ("ignoring all
// other MCP configurations") and already drops those, so an earlier version of this comment was wrong
// to list MCP among what hardening preserves. And B2 must
// come along because `Bun.spawn(["./wrapper.sh"], { cwd: elsewhere })` throws ENOENT → classified
// missing-binary → which withRetry treats as PERMANENT, so the morning dies with no retry on a wrapper
// that exists.
