// scripts/eval.ts — the live `bun run eval` release gate (Task 10). Runs each selected
// GOLD_CASES entry (src/eval/cases.ts) through the REAL pipeline with the REAL provider
// (the hardened BYO provider — e.g. the `claude` CLI) N=3 times, and applies `verdictForRuns`'s pure
// threshold policy (src/eval/thresholds.ts, TDD'd in test/eval/thresholds.test.ts) to decide
// pass/fail per case. Replaces the old ad-hoc grounding-audit dump — see EVAL.md's "superseded"
// note — now that the gold-case scoring machinery (runCase/CHECKS/GOLD_CASES) exists.
//
// Flags:
//   --case <name>   run only the named gold case (default: every entry in GOLD_CASES)
//   --json          emit a machine-readable { pass, posture, postureDetail, truncated, perRule, findings } object
//                    instead of the
//                    human report (perRule is the presentational worst-of across cases:
//                    fail > flaky > pass — it never changes the exit code)
//   --judge         additionally run the non-gating adversarial LLM judge (buildAuditPrompt,
//                    src/audit.ts:126) once per case and print its verdict; it NEVER affects the
//                    exit code — gold cases are synthetic, so the judge's ground truth is the
//                    case's own authored `build` spec, not real git history
//
// This is NOT run in `bun test` — it calls the real provider CLI and can take minutes per case.
// Manual smoke: `bun run eval --case day8-tie`
